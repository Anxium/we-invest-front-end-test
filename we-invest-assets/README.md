# Technical test Front-end Engineer

This technical test is meant for Front-end Engineer candidates.

All of the tasks are described in user stories. This already gives you an idea about the way we like to work as a team.
Of course some of these user stories don't make a lot of sense because they are based on a free dummy API. This is build to test you technical capabilities.

## Objectives

- [ ] Build this application by using this tech stack:
  - A **[REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)**
  - **TypeScript**
  - **React.js**
  - **Next.js**, this is optional. Only use is if you already know it and think it will help you go either faster or deliver a better project.
  - **[TailwindCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss)**
  - **[HeadlessUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headlessui/react)**
- [ ] You have max. 3 hours to complete the test.
- [ ] We will be evaluating what you are able to do based on this. So show us what you're capable of ðŸš€
- [ ] We also expect you to make the right decisions and to be able explain why you made that decision.

## Delivery
We would like to ask you to create a git repo and manage this test in the same way you would for any other project. (Git best practices)

Once you're done with this test we would please ask you to push this on a private GitHub repo and share it with [elliott@weinvest.be](mailto:elliott@weinvest.be).

## Evaluation Criteria

- **TypeScript** and **React** best practices
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
